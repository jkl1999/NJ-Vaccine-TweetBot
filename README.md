# NJ Covid Vaccine Tweetbot
## Follow @NjVaccineFinder on Twitter


The goal of this project is to help people in NJ find covid vaccine appointments.

Currently, the bot is working for the HMHN Appointments at the Meadowlands and in Edison.
We are working on expanding the project for other websites, such as Rowan and the VNACJ and 
hopefully more!
